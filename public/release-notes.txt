SRCS LMS – Release v.10.1 RC (Performance & AI Overhaul)
"Building the future of education through superior engineering."

We heard your feedback on dashboard fluidity. In this release, we stripped down the heavy animation engines and rebuilt the core scrolling mechanics to deliver a 60fps, zero-lag experience. We also aligned our AI tools with DepEd standards for a fairer, smarter classroom assistant.

✨ Headlining Features
1. 🚀 "Butter Smooth" Performance (Major Overhaul)
We optimized the app's rendering engine to respect your device's battery and processing power.

Zero-Lag Scrolling: We removed heavy Framer Motion calculations from the Activity Feed. Scrolling through hundreds of announcements is now instantaneous and lightweight.

Smart Rendering: The dashboard now uses content-visibility technology. The app intelligently "pauses" rendering for off-screen widgets, drastically reducing memory usage and device heating.

Instant Startup: We fixed a layout blocking issue (removed useLayoutEffect) that caused a split-second "stutter" during login. The dashboard now paints immediately.

2. 🧠 AI Intelligence Upgrade
DepEd-Aligned Quiz Generation: We fixed the AI logic to ensure all generated quizzes strictly align with DepEd standards. This guarantees content fairness, appropriate difficulty levels, and cultural relevance for your students.

Smarter Google Slides: The "Text-to-Presentation" engine has an updated prompt structure. Expect clearer slide layouts, better topic structuring, and enhanced visuals for both Teacher lessons and Student reports.

3. 🎨 Visuals & Stability
Refined UI: We tweaked the "Glassmorphism" effects to be easier on the eyes and the GPU. The interface retains its modern look but with better text readability and stability.

Crash Prevention: We consolidated how modals (pop-ups) are handled to prevent overlaps and potential crashes during rapid navigation.
