  "whatsNew": "### Performance and Stability\n- Conducted a general audit of the application to identify and address potential memory leaks and performance issues.\n- Ensured that all components with event listeners and timers have proper cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks and improve application stability.\n- Optimized the `UnitAccordion` component by memoizing child components (`SortableContentItem`, `SortableUnitCard`) and wrapping event handlers in `useCallback` to reduce unnecessary re-renders.\n\n### Security and Anti-Cheating Enhancements (Quiz)\n- **Student Watermark:** Added a dynamic watermark with the student's name to the quiz interface to discourage screenshots and unauthorized sharing.\n- **Disabled Copy/Paste:** Implemented a feature to prevent students from copying, pasting, or cutting content during a quiz.\n- **Developer Tools Detection:** Implemented a more robust mechanism to detect when a user opens the browser's developer tools, which now triggers a warning.\n- **Enhanced Quiz Security:** The combination of these features enhances the integrity of the quiz environment without being overly intrusive."
