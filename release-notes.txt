========================================

### Bug Fixes & Core Logic Improvements

* **Fixed Quiz Retake Bug:** Addressed a critical bug where students retaking a quiz (assigned via a new post) would see their old scores.
* **Unique Post IDs:** Re-engineered quiz and lesson submission logic to use the `postId` as a unique identifier. This ensures every new assignment is treated as a fresh entry, allowing for proper retakes.
* **Teacher Score View Fixed:** Updated the teacher's `QuizScoresModal` to filter submissions by `postId`, ensuring teachers only see scores relevant to the specific post they are viewing.
* **Lesson XP Fix:** Applied the same `postId` logic to lesson completions. Students now correctly earn XP for a lesson *each time* it is assigned in a new post, rather than just once.


### UI Enhancements

* **New Badge Icons:** Replaced the previous emoji-based badge icons with a new, aesthetically pleasing set from the Lucide React library for a cleaner, more professional look on the Profile and Dashboard pages.
* **Dark Mode:** Dark mode is now fully supported across the application. 


### Gamification Features

* Added core gamification features for students. 
* (Note: The Lesson XP Fix above also enhances this feature.)


### Security and Anti-Cheating (Quiz)

* **Student Watermark:** Added a dynamic watermark with the student's name to the quiz interface. 4]
* **Disabled Copy/Paste:** Implemented a feature to prevent students from copying, pasting, or cutting content during a quiz. 
* **Developer Tools Detection:** Implemented a more robust mechanism to detect when a user opens the browser's developer tools.
* **Enhanced Security:** The combination of these features enhances the integrity of the quiz environment.


### Performance and Stability

* Conducted a general audit to identify and address potential memory leaks. 
* Ensured all components with event listeners and timers have proper cleanup functions. 
* Optimized the `UnitAccordion` component by memoizing child components and using `useCallback` to reduce unnecessary re-renders. 


### AI Engine

* Adopted a triple AI-engine model to ensure seamless processing.
