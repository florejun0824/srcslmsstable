SRCS LMS v10.4: A New Era of Speed, Beauty, and Intelligence

We aren't just updating your Learning Management System; we are reimagining how you teach and learn. Version 10.3 represents our biggest leap forward yet—a seamless blend of raw performance, stunning "Neo-Glass" visuals, and next-generation AI that doesn't just assist, but anticipates.

🧠 Intelligence Unleashed: Powered by Gemini 3 Pro
We have upgraded the "brain" of our ecosystem. By integrating Gemini 3 Pro, the world's most advanced multimodal reasoning model, your digital teaching assistant has achieved a generational leap in IQ.

Deep Pedagogical Reasoning: Unlike standard models, Gemini 3 Pro performs complex, multi-step reasoning. It understands the nuances of curriculum alignment, creating exams, quizzes, and lesson plans with unprecedented academic rigor.

Multimodal Mastery: The AI now "sees" and "hears" like a teacher. Upload a complex diagram, a handwritten essay, or a research paper with nested tables—Gemini 3 Pro will analyze and grade it with expert-level precision.

Automated Document Architect: From generating complex LaTeX math code to building structured research reports, the system now handles the "heavy lifting" of document creation so you can focus on teaching.

🎨 The "Neo-Glass" Visual Revolution
Experience the new standard of educational design. We’ve introduced a complete visual overhaul centered on Neo-Glass—a design language that combines depth, clarity, and fluid motion.

Full Immersion Mode: Dive into a cinematic entry experience featuring animated mesh gradients, "liquid" input fields, and dynamic particles that respond to your movements.

Adaptive Performance (Full vs. Lite): Choose your experience. Full Mode delivers the complete "Neo-Glass" aesthetic, while the new Lite Mode strips away heavy effects for a crisp, distraction-free interface that maximizes speed on any device.

Monet Dynamic Theming: The entire LMS now adapts to your personality. Dynamic theming ensures your workspace is as unique as your teaching style.

⚡ Re-Engineered for Fluidity
We believe education should be instantaneous. We’ve stripped away legacy rendering engines, replacing them with hardware-accelerated transitions. Whether you're on a high-end desktop or a budget mobile device, the interface feels buttery smooth and remarkably responsive.

🗳️ Student Voices & Election Command Center
Student leadership starts here. Our new Election Module makes organizing grade-level or school-wide elections effortless. Manage candidates, cast secure votes, and watch real-time results roll in—democracy, digitized.

🛠️ Professional Tools for Modern Educators
Presentation Architect: Our Automated Slide Generator now features a Design Picker, letting you match the visual style of your slides to your subject matter in a single click.

Ironclad Security: We’ve fortified our data protocols to banking-grade standards, ensuring your research and student data remain private and secure.
